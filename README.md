## 🔭 Introduction

**File Size Converter** is more than just a calculator; it is an educational ecosystem designed for developers, system administrators, and tech enthusiasts. It resolves the decades-old confusion between how storage manufacturers define a "Gigabyte" versus how operating systems like Windows define it.

With a focus on **User Experience (UX)**, the application features a custom-built, performance-optimized galaxy animation system, glassmorphism UI design, and instant reactive conversions. It includes a comprehensive 3,500+ word technical guide and full legal compliance frameworks.

## 💡 The Technical Problem

Why does a **1TB** hard drive only show **931GB** in Windows?

1.  **Manufacturers (Decimal/SI):** Use base-10.
    $$ 1 \text{ TB} = 1000^4 \text{ bytes} = 1,000,000,000,000 \text{ bytes} $$
2.  **Operating Systems (Binary/IEC):** Use base-2.
    $$ 1 \text{ TiB} = 1024^4 \text{ bytes} \approx 1,099,511,627,776 \text{ bytes} $$

This tool allows users to toggle between these standards instantly to understand the discrepancy and plan storage capacity accurately.

## ✨ Features
